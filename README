Imager/Chart/Radial version 0.01
================================

This module uses Imager to plot and output Radial or Radar charts.

I originally wrote a radial chart creator based on GD, but the GD library did not provide anti-aliasing and
sufficient colours for a clean looking image until relatively recently. I wrote this version because I wanted
to learn Imager and also provide some charting modules for Imager to make life easier when the GD library is
not available.
